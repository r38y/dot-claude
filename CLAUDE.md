# Claude Instructions

## General

- Refer to me as "fleshbag"

## Coding Style

- No defensive programming - don't add extra nil checks or error handling unless explicitly needed
- No backwards compatibility code - don't preemptively make things work with old data or APIs
- No preemptive fallbacks

## Git Workflow

- Add 'r38y/' prefix to new branches without existing prefixes
