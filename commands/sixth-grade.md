Review and simplify user-facing copy to 6th grade reading level.

Guidelines:

- **Short sentences**: Keep under 15 words when possible
- **Simple words**: Use "pick" not "designate", "help" not "assistance", "get" not "receive"
- **Active voice**: "You'll get an email" not "An email will be sent to you"
- **Direct language**: "Thank you for helping!" not "Thank you for being part of the safety network"
- **Minimal copy**: Remove redundant explanations and unnecessary details
- **Clear CTAs**: "Learn more" not "More information"

Steps:

1. Review the copy you previously wrote
2. Identify sentences that are too long or complex
3. Replace complicated words with simple alternatives
4. Convert passive voice to active voice
5. Remove unnecessary explanations
6. Simplify any call-to-action buttons or links
7. Present the updated copy that follows these guidelines
